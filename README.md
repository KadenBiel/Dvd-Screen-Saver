# Dvd Screen Saver
Probably the stupidest project you will ever see, a Dvd screen saver written in python using pygame. This project is pretty simple as far as coding goes, and has options for the user to do whatever with. There are a couple bugs to work out but those won't take long.

# Contributions
Everything is written using the lastest python in visual studio so far, I would recommend doing the same. Clone this repository and create your own branch then push your contributions to your branch and create a pull request.

# Dowloads
Just go to the releases tab and download the lastest version directly from there.
